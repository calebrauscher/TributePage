        <p>My first official race was the Pittsburgh Great Race 5k on September 30, 2012. I finshed in 28:14. I felt in good enough shape but I have learned a lot over the years. I zig zagged all over that course wearing basketball shorts and cotton socks.
          The next day I was extremely sore but was prepared to continue on this running journey</p>
        <p>I know needed to find a new goal. I searched for a goal and debated my next step. At first I considered a 10k or possibly a half marathon but thought if a half marathon felt difficult how would I ever convince myself to complete a full marathon
          so I started looking for a full marathon plan.</p>
        <p>I started looking for a plan that would get me prepared but would also be doable. I settled on a plan from myAsics that included 3 days of running. I chose 3 miles rather than 4 miles because I felt I could definitely commit to 3 days a week.
          The week day run had a mix of easy running and faster paced runs with slowly growing long weekend runs. My confindence grew each week as I hit a new longest run starting at 7 miles, then 10 miles, then 15 miles, and finally 20 miles.</p>
        <p>There were set backs in my training. In February I got sick and could not run for about 2 weeks. Feeling behind I thought I needed to jump right back in and ended up getting injured. A couple of weeks of PT and I was back to training.</p>
        <p>I finished my first marathon in Pittsburgh on May 5, 2013 in 4:34:55 seconds. From there on it was just a matter of improving that time.</p>

        <h2>Pittsburgh Marathon</h2>
      <p>The Dick's Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon, commonly referred to as the Pittsburgh Marathon, is an annual marathon footrace held on the first Sunday in May in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the United States. The Marathon was first announced on
        UPMC's withdraw from title sponsor led to suspension of the race from 2004 to 2008. In 2009, the event was revived with a new title sponsor, Dick's Sporting Goods, and renewed interest in the race. The 1988 and 2000 races were USA Olympic Trials
        for women and men, that were held separately from the regular event although both were held over the same course</p>
